# Caesar Cryptography Tool
Author: Joelbu537
## Usecase
Caesar can be used to de/encrypt simple string messages.

**Warning:** This method is not even close to being safe, and can be easily cracked.
(Im working on a cracker :) )

## How to use
When launched for the first time, you are required to select some preferences(How to deal with blanks and special chars).
> [!CAUTION]
> Blanks don't work yet.

Simply enter the phrase/string you want to work with and press enter.
**To encrypt**, enter a encryption key of your favor(A number beween -25 and 25).
**To decrypt**, enter the encryption key multiplied by -1. You (of course) need to know the key used to encrypt the message.
Caesar is going to process the phrase and pring the in -and output.

### Example

***String:***  Hello World                                                             
***Encryption level (Use negative numbers to decode):***  17                                         
***Input:  HELLO WORLD***                                                 
***Output: yvccfnficu***
